abstract: We introduce a Large Scale Multi-Illuminant (LSMI) Dataset that
  contains 7,486 images, captured with three different cameras on more than
  2,700 scenes with two or three illuminants. For each image in the dataset, the
  new dataset provides not only the pixel-wise ground truth illumination but
  also the chromaticity of each illuminant in the scene and the mixture ratio of
  illuminants per pixel. Images in our dataset are mostly captured with
  illuminants existing in the scene, and the ground truth illumination is
  computed by taking the difference between the images with different
  illumination combination. Therefore, our dataset captures natural composition
  in the real-world setting with wide field-of-view, providing more extensive
  dataset compared to existing datasets for multi-illumination white balance. As
  conventional single illuminant white balance algorithms cannot be directly
  applied, we also apply per-pixel DNN-based white balance algorithm and show
  its effectiveness against using patch-wise white balancing. We validate the
  benefits of our dataset through extensive analysis including a user-study, and
  expect the dataset to make meaningful contribution for future work in white
  balancing.
